### 0.8.0 [BREAKING CHANGES]

- [class-transformer](https://github.com/typestack/class-transformer) and [class-validator](https://github.com/typestack/class-validator) are now peer dependencies.

#### Features

- extract generic `@Session()` deocorator into `@SessionParam()` and `@Session()` (ref [#335][#348][#407])
- restore/introduce `@QueryParams()` and `@Params()` missing decorators options (ref [#289][#289])
